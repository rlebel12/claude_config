# Executing an Engineering Task (Alt)

Your task is to execute the plan documented in @$ARGUMENTS . Execute the steps/tasks/phases one at a time, using a technical executor subagent for each. Once each phase is complete, update the planning document to track your progress. Finally, `git commit` the changes, including the documentation update.
