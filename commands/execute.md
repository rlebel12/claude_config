# Executing an Engineering Task

Use the technical-plan-executor subagent to execute the next step in this technical planning document: @$ARGUMENTS . You must identify and plan/execute ONLY the next step in the plan, but you should include the sub-steps, if applicable. For example, if the project is broken down into steps 1 (complete), 2, and 3, where 2 is broken down into 2.1, 2.2, and 2.3, you will execute 2.1, 2.2, and 2.3, but not 3.
